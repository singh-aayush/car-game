            <h1>--: Traffic Car Racing :--</h1>
            <p> <pre> Traffic car games are a video game in which the player participates in a racing competition.
                  Traffic Racer is a racing game where you need to drive through a highway full of traffic, avoiding all
                 of the vehicles traveling in the opposite direction until you meet your inevitable end in a crash.

                <h1> History Of Car Games...</h1>
              
                    <p> <pre> One of the last successful electro-mechanical arcade games was F-1, a racinggame developed
                    and released by Namco in 1976, and distributed in North America by Atari the same year. The gameplay
                     is viewed from the perspective of the driver'sviewpoint, which is displayed on the screen using a 
                     projector system.Another notable EM game from the 1970s was The Driver, a racing-action game 
                     released by Kasco (Kansai Seiki Seisakusho Co.) that used 16 mm film to projectfull motion video on 
                     screen, though its gameplay had limited interaction, requiring the player to match their steering 
                     wheel, gas pedal and brakes with movements shown on screen, much like the sequences in later 
                     LaserDisc games.

                    <h1>Making Procedure.....</h1>
                    <hr>  <h2>1. HTML -:</h2>
                   <p> <pre>
                        I had using HTML for making this game. As we know that HTML is called Hyper text markup language 
                        and also we say that the structure of a body. Through which we are giving command to the editor
                         and it will perform the function.

                    <hr>   <h2>2. CSS -:</h2>
                    <p> <pre>
                         Also using CSS which is commonly known as Cascading Style Sheets. This is mostly using in styling
                         our web pages. And it is very simple in use because its gives lots of ways to perform our 
                         function.

                    </pre> </p>
                    <hr>    <h2>3. JAVASCRIPT -:</h2>
                    <p> <pre>
                        Now the javascript is most important thing which is used by any programmer. Because it provide a 
                        platform through which we are giving command as well as controling our sites. It also make a
                         server like (express, socket.io, nodemon, etc.). This all are helping us to provide a 'local' as well as 'live' server.
